Project Directx 3D 11

Box creation with size and position only (Färdigt?)

1.2 
Mandatory techniques or implementation details: 
- You have to use a “perspective” camera, 
- You have to use textures in your 3D models, 
- You have to implement ambient, diffuse AND specular phong shading per pixel. 
- You have to implement one camera control mode: either FPS or ORBIT, 
  o FPS: Use “w-a-s-d” for moving and the mouse for looking at different directions 
  
  
Geometry (2):

  o Parsing and rendering an existing model format (OBJ, MD5, etc). This includes parsing and using the material defined in the           
    format (textures). If you use a library like Assimp, it does not count Done (not if Material has to be loaded in)
 
   
  o Height-map terrain rendering, user can walk on the terrain using WASD keys._Karlos_
 
  
Texturing and Lighting (1): 
    _Daniel_
  o Normal mapping

Keyboard, inputs, Camera, FPS
  _Karlos_
  o FPS done! 
  o Keyboard done!
  o simple physics (jump and fall)
