Mandatory techniques or implementation details: 
- You have to use a “perspective” camera,

- You have to implement ambient, diffuse AND specular phong shading per pixel. 
- You have to implement one camera control mode: either FPS or ORBIT, 
  o FPS: Use “w-a-s-d” for moving and the mouse for looking at different directions
